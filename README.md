# LAB - 05a

## Write some functions on Git branches.

I was asked to write 6 functions in this lab. For each function, I worked on an independant branch and ACP it when I completed the function. I made PR request from my branch to main branch and then merged it. At last, I pulled the most recent code to my local.
